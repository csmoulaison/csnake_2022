# Snake Re-Implementation Written in C
This was a nice and simple bit of practice code, and was very fun to create. Digging into a tiny, fully specified, static design allowed me to focus on writing super clean, simple code.

There's some decisions I would make differently now, and I have updated this repo with a first pass at those as of October 2024. I would like to do more of that, and perhaps use it as a testbed in the future for non-game-design architectural concerns, such as a multiplatform deployment pipeline.
